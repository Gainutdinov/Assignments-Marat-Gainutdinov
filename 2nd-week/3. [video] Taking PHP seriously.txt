"worse is better"
PHP is used in Facebook, Wordpress, Drupal, Mediawiki
bad suprises, against PHP:
		$x / 0 // => bool(false)
		"11abcd" + "1xy" // => int(12)
		"0123" + "3456" // => int(3579)
		"0123" | "3456" // => string("3577")

	inconsisten, dangerous standard library
		array_map vs. array_reduce argument orders
		array_merge
		mysql_escape_string vs (sigh) mysql_real_escape_string
In Defense of PHP:
	PHP gets three important things really right
		programmer workflow (save reload-the-page, short feedback cycle, optimizes most precious resource of all: programmer short-term memory)
		state (All PHP code on a server is the request)
		concurrency (PHP request execute in a single thread, limits PHP's applicable domain)
HipHop for PHP - transpiler source-to-source compiler, PHP code is translated into C++ code, was created by Facebook.
HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in Hack (programming language for HHVM) and PHP.
So, HHVM created to increase compiling source PHP code into machine code faster (swifter).
