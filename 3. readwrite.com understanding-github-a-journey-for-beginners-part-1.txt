GitHub For Beginners: Commit, Push And Go
mkdir ~/MyProject
cd ~/MyProject
git init
touch Readme.txt
git status #to check status of the repo
git add Readme.txt
git commit -m “Add Readme.txt” #The -m flag simply indicates that the following text should be read as a message.
git remote add origin https://github.com/Gainutdinov/first-project.git #add origin (remote) repo to your local repo
git remote -v #This command gives you a list of all the remote origins your local repository knows about.
git push --set-upstream origin master #to "push" our repo to the origin (remote) repo
And finally we will get all our local changes be copied to origin repo.

Repository
Version Control
Commit (Snapshot)
Branch (to merge two branches we use "merge")

git init #only after that command a folder will become a git repo
git config  #Short for “configure,” this is most useful when you’re setting up Git for the first time.
git add #After you add files, they’re included in Git’s “snapshots” of the repository.
git commit -m "My message" #After you make any sort of change, you input this in order to take a “snapshot” of the repository
git branch cats #This command will let you build a new branch
git checkout master #navigational command that lets you move to the repository you want to check branch or repo.
git merge cats #would take all the changes you made to the “cats” branch and add them to the master.
git push #you “push” the changes up to GitHub with this command
git pull #you “pull” the changes down from GitHub with this command
git remote -v #manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.
