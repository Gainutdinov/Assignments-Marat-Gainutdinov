Docker for Dummies
	Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers 
from any application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop 
can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.
	LXC (LinuX Containers) is an operating system-level virtualization method for running multiple 
isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single control host.
	Interesting Containers share the OS. They just have isolated process spaces. And the best thing
about containers is the fact that they use a layered file system called AuFS 
(short for advanced multi-layered unification filesystem)
Main features of docker:
	Throwable Sandboxes
	Elegant Application Delivery
	Create uniform development and production Environments
