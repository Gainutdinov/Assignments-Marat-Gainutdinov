Use Case 1: Docker for Local Application Development and Test
	Works on my machine → Works again on my machine tomorrow → Works on a test machine

Use Case 2: Docker for Development Team Collaboration
	Works on my machine → Works on your machine

Use Case 3: Docker for Continuous Integration
	You won't need time to spend for build up your custom dev. environment into clients machines

Use Case 4: Docker for Production Application Deployment
	Works on my machine → Works on QA machines → Works (the same) on... 
	...production hardware → Stays working (securely) on the production environment
