First of all we should initialize our repo, so 
> git init
after that we should add files to repo, via typing
> git add <filename>
after that we should add commit
> git commit
commit creates a Head & in Master branch, before the commit command the file will be without the file
to show 
>git status
Let's create a branch and call branch feature
> git branch feature
and furthermore we will work in feature branch
after the commit command
> touch bar.txt
> git commit
now we will on the next commit (point) with head and then use feature branch 
in a same time our master branch will be stay on previous commit (point)
now let's look at ID = content + author + date + log + previous commit, 
also important  all commit, id's are unique and  commits never change
> git merge feature
after above command git will merge Master branch and feature branch, after that it will 
move Master label to current commit (point)
